Hello. This is an incredible story about a very intresting person. 
The person's name is Bill. Bill is a computer science student at Wadison College and is very bad at writing fiction.
For that reason Bill decided to major in Computer Engineering. Then one day a genie came along and made Bill write a
story. This made Bill very sad. Bill huffed and puffed until eventually he typed out enough words where the fictional
dragon deemed him worthy of completing the assignment. 

While Bill certainly didn't want to have to write a story, he enjoyed it more than he originally thought he would. 
Bill realized that writing wasn't so scary after all. Bill got credit for completing the assignment, but more than that, 
Bill had a bit of fun too. Having to write a story this open-ended wasn't easy, it was fairly enjoyable. Bill
ended up enrolling in a Creative Writing class afterward. 

Bill was transformed by this creative writing class. He soon started exploring the endless possibilities writing had to offer.
Bill was encouraged by his rap scripts. Soon after freestyling infront of the class, everyone wanted to be his friend.
He released a music video, which was scrappily made in his dorm's hallways, which was met with raving reviews.
Bill's life was transformed by this writing class.
