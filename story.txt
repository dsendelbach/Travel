Hello. This is an incredible story about a very intresting person. 
The person's name is Bill. Bill is a computer science student at Wadison College and is very bad at writing fiction.
For that reason Bill decided to major in Computer Engineering. Then one day a genie came along and made Bill write a
story. This made Bill very sad. Bill huffed and puffed until eventually he typed out enough words where the fictional
dragon deemed him worthy of completing the assignment. 

Then the dragon laughed, saying Bill must find two friends to write more words to complete the genies assignment. Bill
contradicted by saying there there was a not-so-deadly virus called DIVOC-91 which made it so he could not find any friends. 
The dragon simply gave Bill a computer and told him to go on FaceMovie and find some friends online. Bill huffed and puffed
again but eventually found two friends John and Matt. John didn't mind writing words but wanted to help out Bill so he
tried to do the assignment like Bill. This was very hard for John because Bill did not like fictional writing. But eventually 
John wrote enough words that the fictional dragon deemed him worthy enough of completing the assignment.
