Hello. This is an incredible story about a very intresting person. 
The person's name is Bill. Bill is a computer science student at Wadison College and is very bad at writing fiction.
For that reason Bill decided to major in Computer Engineering. Then one day a genie came along and made Bill write a
story. This made Bill very sad. Bill huffed and puffed until eventually he typed out enough words where the fictional
dragon deemed him worthy of completing the assignment.
